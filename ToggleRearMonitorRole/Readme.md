### Toggle the Monitor Role of a Rear Monitor

In classrooms with three monitors (one in the rear) that are running in **Dual** Monitor Mode, 
this macro will toggle the monitor role of *Monitor 3*. This allows the instructor to choose
whether they see the remote participants or the shared presentation on the rear monitor.

#### Layout A
The rear monitor mirrors *Monitor 1*, which is typically the left screen. The instructor will
see remote participants when on a call.

#### Layout B
The rear monitor mirrors *Monitor 2*, which is typically the right screen. The instructor will
see shared content when there is a presentation, or they will see the overflow of participants.
